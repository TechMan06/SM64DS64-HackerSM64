# Super Mario 64 DS *64*

Hello!
## Have you ever wanted to play Super Mario 64 DS, but you're:
- Not a fan of the new graphics.
- Hates the Nintendo DS controllers.
- Does not like having your game split into two screens.

Well then, I think this project is for you! This project is basically almost the entirety of Super Mario 64 DS "demaked" into Super Mario 64, and it even runs on actual N64 hardware.

## About
This is a project started by TechMan06 in January 1st 2024, with the goal of being a challenging project to teach him more about the sm64 decomp, the project ides was picked for not being too ambitious, while also being challenging, good enough for a developer somewhere in between a beginner and an intermediate.

This project is being made with the focus of learning, and having fun, that being said, I (TechMan06) cannot guarantee I will be finishing it 100% or making it 100% perfect, and any progress relies on whenever I feel like doing it.

This project is open-source so anyone can compile and enjoy it throughout its development and also so people can study and watch the things I did here, how the code works, and hopefully use that knowledge to make their very own romhacks
